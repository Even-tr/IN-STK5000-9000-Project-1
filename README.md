## Repository structure

The main file is `script.py`, which was exctrated from `NotebookV2.ipynb`. Helper functions has been moced to `helpers.py` to avoid clutter and for testing. The consol output is saved in the `output.txt` file (simply piped in), and finally, all images used are saved in the 'images' folder.

## How to run
```
>>> python3 script.py > output.txt
```

## Extra dependencies
We use `dataframe_image` to make pretty tables from data frames
