## Repository structure

The main file is `script.py`. Helper functions is in `helpers.py`. The console output is saved in the `output.txt` file (simply piped in), and finally, all images used are saved in the 'images' folder.

## How to run
```
>>> python3 script.py > output.txt
```

## Extra dependencies

We followed the advice given in Lecture 2 to not use a Jupyter Notebook. Having done that, we need a way to print dataframes for our presentation. We use the `dataframe_image` to make pretty tables from data frames.
